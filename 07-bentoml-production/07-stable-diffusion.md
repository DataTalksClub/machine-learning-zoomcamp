## Notes

This lesson is about deploying an open-source model on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2). The model is called Stable Diffusion which takes prompt as text and/or image from the user and transform it into an image.

BentoML has a nice user-friendly instructions on their GitHub page to use the model and deploy it on EC2.
