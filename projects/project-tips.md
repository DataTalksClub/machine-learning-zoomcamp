# Project Tips and Checklist

This guide summarizes best practices for your midterm and capstone projects.

It's based on Alexey's project discussion video: https://www.youtube.com/live/GuJkBzyGxyc?si=xdgNWXemt-1U_Sph

## 1. Choosing Your Problem & Dataset

- **Pick something you actually find interesting.**  
A relatable problem keeps you motivated through debugging and deployment.

- **Keep scope realistic.**  
If a Kaggle notebook already solves a similar task, it's likely doable in 2 weeks.

- **Dataset sanity checks**
  - Publicly available and easy to download
  - Not too small (< 500 rows) or too big (> 1 GB)
  - Clear target variable
  - Reasonable amount of missing data (you'll handle it in preprocessing)

> *Tip:* Start by browsing past cohort projects for inspiration.

## 2. Problem Framing

- Clearly **describe the problem** in the README: what you're predicting, who benefits, and how the model will be used.
- Define an **evaluation metric** appropriate to your task:
  - Balanced classification → Accuracy or AUC-ROC
  - Imbalanced classification → Precision, Recall, or PR Curve
  - Regression → RMSE / MAE
- Add a short note on **why this problem matters**.

## 3. Data Preparation & EDA

- Document data source and retrieval steps.
- Explore distributions, missing values, correlations, outliers.
- Feature-engineer only what's necessary — keep it interpretable.
- Keep preprocessing steps **reproducible** (functions or scripts).

## 4. Modeling

- Start with a **baseline** (Logistic/Linear model or shallow tree).  
- Train at least **3 models**, tune key hyperparameters, and select the best.  
- Use **cross-validation** and keep a summary table of scores.
- **Check for label leakage** — don't include target-derived features:
  - For every feature, ask: *would I actually know this value at prediction time?*
    Columns recorded after the outcome (actual delivery days, discharge date,
    final status) encode the answer instead of predicting it.
  - Quick test: train a model on **each feature alone**. If one feature by
    itself gets near-perfect scores, it's almost certainly leaking the target.
  - Treat a suspiciously high score as a symptom, not a success. A real
    example from a popular capstone dataset: DataCo late-delivery prediction
    scores ~97% with the shipping-time columns included — but the label is
    *computed from* those columns, so the model just restates the definition.
    With only the features knowable at order time, the same models get ~69%
    ([audit with reproduction scripts](https://github.com/ipezygj/dataco-late-delivery-audit)).
    The lower number is the real one — and it's the one worth putting in
    your README, with a sentence explaining why.

## 5. From Notebook → Script

Refactor your final notebook into:
```

train.py      # trains model and saves artifact
predict.py    # loads model, runs inference
serve.py      # starts web service
```

## 6. Web Service

- Implement a **Flask/FastAPI** (or similar) app exposing:
  - `POST /predict` – accepts JSON input, returns prediction
  - `GET /health` – simple 200 OK check
- Provide an example request in the README:
  ```bash
  curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
       -d '{"feature1": 3.2, "feature2": "A"}' \
       http://localhost:9696/predict

## 7. Dockerization

✅ Required for the project evaluation.
Include a working `Dockerfile`, e.g.:

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.11-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
EXPOSE 9696
CMD ["python", "serve.py"]
```

Add build/run instructions:

```bash
docker build -t myproject .
docker run -it -p 9696:9696 myproject
```

## 8. (Bonus) Cloud Deployment

Optional but earns extra points:

* Deploy to AWS, GCP, Azure, or PythonAnywhere.
* Include:

  * Access instructions or screenshots
  * A short demo of successful prediction
  * Teardown info to avoid extra costs

## 9. Documentation & Structure

A good README includes:

1. Problem statement
2. Dataset description
3. EDA summary
4. Modeling approach & metrics
5. How to run locally and via Docker
6. API usage example
7. Known limitations / next steps

Add one simple **diagram or architecture sketch** (data → model → API) if possible.

## 10. Peer Review Readiness

Before submission:

* Clone your repo fresh and ensure everything runs from scratch.
* Tag or note the **exact commit hash** you'll submit.
* Check that all files needed for reproducibility are included.
* Write clear setup and run instructions — reviewers should need <10 minutes to verify.

## 11. Learning in Public

Share short updates during your build — screenshots, threads, or LinkedIn posts.
You can add up to **14 public learning links** in the submission form.

## 12. Common Pitfalls to Avoid

🚫 Don't skip peer review — fewer than 3 reviews → project fail
🚫 Don't replace Flask/FastAPI + Docker with Gradio/Streamlit (they're great extras, not substitutes)
🚫 Don't copy-paste other students' projects — inspiration ≠ duplication
🚫 Don't leave Docker setup or deployment for the last day

## 13. Time & Effort

Plan for **15–20 hours** total:

* 5h exploring & EDA
* 5h modeling & tuning
* 3h refactoring + testing
* 5h packaging & deployment
* 2h documentation & peer review prep
