# How to Submit and Review Projects

This guide is based on [Alexey's video guide](https://www.loom.com/share/4f5c155c550e48ddb54b71ba76516b04). You can watch it for a visual guide.

## Submitting Your Project

1. Go to your course page on the course platform: https://courses.datatalks.club/
2. Open the **project submission form**.
3. Prepare your materials:

   * **GitHub repo URL** (you can use a separate repo or a subfolder in your course repo).
   * **Commit ID** of your final project version.
   * (Optional) Up to **14 “learning in public” links** — posts where you shared your progress.
   * (Optional) Link to your **FAQ contribution**, if any.
4. Review your **certificate name** — it will appear exactly as entered.
You can edit it under *Enrollment Details → Name on certificate*.

5. Submit the form.

Even after the deadline, you can still submit while the form remains open (it may be closed manually anytime).

## Reviewing Peer Projects
Once the form closes, you’ll automatically receive **3 peer review assignments**.

Each assignment includes a GitHub project link and a specific **commit hash** to review.

Peer review is part of your learning. Take time to explore how others approached their projects.

### How to review your peers?
1. Open each assigned project on GitHub (To check the correct version, use the commit link (`/commit/<commit_id>`))
2. Evaluate the project using the official **criteria** (problem description, reproducibility, deployment, etc.).
3. For each criterion, assign points based on completeness and quality.
4. (Optional but recommended) Try to **run the project locally** to verify reproducibility. (If the dataset is private or the cloud setup is inaccessible, judge reproducibility based on the documentation.)
5. Leave short, constructive **feedback** — what worked well and what could be improved.
6. Submit your review and record the **time spent**.
7. (Optional) Review extra projects for additional learning.

Notes:

* If you get a clearly fake or placeholder project (as shown in the demo), give **zero points**.
* Focus on **effort, completeness, and documentation**, not model accuracy.
