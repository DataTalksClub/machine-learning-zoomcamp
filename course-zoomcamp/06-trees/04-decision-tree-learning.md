## Notes

This lesson first reviews the topics learned in previous lesson about training a decision tress using sklearn, how to handle the model not generalizing due to overfitting of the data. 

In this lesson, we learn about how to best split a decision tree and different classification criteria that can be used to split a tree. We dive deep using an example and splitting the tree using `misclassification` criteria. Additionally, different stopping criteria to break the iterative tree split critiera are discussed.
