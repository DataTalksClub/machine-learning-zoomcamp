## Notes

Add notes from the video (PRs are welcome)

* convolutional neural networks (CNN) consist of different types of layers
* convolutional layer as filters (i.e. 5 x 5)
* dense layers
* sliding the filter across the cells of the entire image
* calculating similarity scores of the different positions of the filter
* creating the feature map, one feature map per filter
* chaining layers of simple and complex filters allows the CNN to "learn"
* resulting in vector representation of image
* activation functions sigmoid for binary classification and softmax for multiclass
