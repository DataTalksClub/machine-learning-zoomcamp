## Notes

Calculation of the RMSE on validation partition of the dataset of car price prediction. In this way, we have a metric to evaluate the model's 
performance. 

The entire code of this project is available in [this jupyter notebook](https://github.com/alexeygrigorev/mlbookcamp-code/blob/master/chapter-02-car-price/02-carprice.ipynb).
