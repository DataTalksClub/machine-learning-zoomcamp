### Dataset

In this homework, we will use the Students Performance in 2024 JAMB dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/idowuadamo/students-performance-in-2024-jamb).

Here's a wget-able [link](https://github.com/alexeygrigorev/datasets/raw/refs/heads/master/jamb_exam_results.csv):

```bash
wget https://github.com/alexeygrigorev/datasets/raw/refs/heads/master/jamb_exam_results.csv
```

The goal of this homework is to create a regression model for predicting the performance of students on a standardized test (column `'JAMB_Score'`).


### Preparing the dataset 

First, let's make the names lowercase:

```python
df.columns = df.columns.str.lower().str.replace(' ', '_')
```

Preparation:

* Remove the `student_id` column.
* Fill missing values with zeros.
* Do train/validation/test split with 60%/20%/20% distribution. 
* Use the `train_test_split` function and set the `random_state` parameter to 1.
* Use `DictVectorizer(sparse=True)` to turn the dataframes into matrices.


## Question 1

Let's train a decision tree regressor to predict the `jamb_score` variable. 

* Train a model with `max_depth=1`.


Which feature is used for splitting the data?

* `study_hours_per_week`
* `attendance_rate`
* `teacher_quality`
* `distance_to_school`


## Question 2

Train a random forest regressor with these parameters:

* `n_estimators=10`
* `random_state=1`
* `n_jobs=-1` (optional - to make training faster)


What's the RMSE of this model on the validation data?

* 22.13
* 42.13
* 62.13
* 82.12


## Question 3

Now let's experiment with the `n_estimators` parameter

* Try different values of this parameter from 10 to 200 with step 10.
* Set `random_state` to `1`.
* Evaluate the model on the validation dataset.


After which value of `n_estimators` does RMSE stop improving?
Consider 3 decimal places for calculating the answer.

- 10
- 25
- 80
- 200


## Question 4

Let's select the best `max_depth`:

* Try different values of `max_depth`: `[10, 15, 20, 25]`
* For each of these values,
  * try different values of `n_estimators` from 10 till 200 (with step 10)
  * calculate the mean RMSE 
* Fix the random seed: `random_state=1`


What's the best `max_depth`, using the mean RMSE?

* 10
* 15
* 20
* 25


# Question 5

We can extract feature importance information from tree-based models. 

At each step of the decision tree learning algorithm, it finds the best split. 
When doing it, we can calculate "gain" - the reduction in impurity before and after the split. 
This gain is quite useful in understanding what are the important features for tree-based models.

In Scikit-Learn, tree-based models contain this information in the
[`feature_importances_`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestRegressor.html#sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestRegressor.feature_importances_)
field. 

For this homework question, we'll find the most important feature:

* Train the model with these parameters:
  * `n_estimators=10`,
  * `max_depth=20`,
  * `random_state=1`,
  * `n_jobs=-1` (optional)
* Get the feature importance information from this model


What's the most important feature (among these 4)? 

* `study_hours_per_week`
* `attendance_rate`
* `distance_to_school`
* `teacher_quality`


## Question 6

Now let's train an XGBoost model! For this question, we'll tune the `eta` parameter:

* Install XGBoost
* Create DMatrix for train and validation
* Create a watchlist
* Train a model with these parameters for 100 rounds:

```
xgb_params = {
    'eta': 0.3, 
    'max_depth': 6,
    'min_child_weight': 1,
    
    'objective': 'reg:squarederror',
    'nthread': 8,
    
    'seed': 1,
    'verbosity': 1,
}
```

Now change `eta` from `0.3` to `0.1`.

Which eta leads to the best RMSE score on the validation dataset?

* 0.3
* 0.1
* Both give equal value
