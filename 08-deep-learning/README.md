## 8. Neural Networks and Deep Learning

Note: in the module we use TensorFlow+Keras. These videos 
were recorded a while ago, and while they are still
relevant, PyTorch became the to-go framework for training
neural networks. 

That's why we also re-recorded the content of this module
with PyTorch. You can find the materials in the [pytorch/](pytorch/) folder.

We don't go over the theory in the PyTorch part. For that,
refer to the main module (the one that still uses Keras).

How to watch it:

- If you want to learn PyTorch only, watch the module content for the theory only and then follow along the content of the PyTorch part
- If you want to learn both (and have time), first do the module and then the PyTorch part
