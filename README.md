## About ML Zoomcamp

This is a practical course where you'll learn to build and deploy machine learning systems. We focus on the engineering side from training models to getting them to work in production.

**You'll learn:**
- Core ML algorithms and when to use them
- Scikit-Learn and XGBoost
- Preparing data, feature engineering
- Model evaluation and selection
- Deploying models with FastAPI, uv, Docker, and cloud platforms
- Using Kubernetes for ML model serving
- Deep learning with PyTorch and TensorFlow

**Technical setup**: For machine learning modules, you only need a laptop with an internet connection. For deep learning sections, we'll use cloud resources for more intensive computations.

## Prerequisites

**You'll need:**
- Prior programming experience (at least 1+ year)
- Comfort with command line basics

You don't need any prior experience with machine learning. We'll start from the basics.

## Syllabus

### [Module 1: Introduction to Machine Learning](01-intro/)

Learn the fundamentals: what ML is, when to use it, and how to approach ML problems using the CRISP-DM framework.

**Topics:**
- ML vs rule-based systems
- Supervised learning basics
- CRISP-DM methodology
- Model selection concepts
- Environment setup

### [Module 2: Machine Learning for Regression](02-regression/)

### [Module 9: Kubernetes & TensorFlow Serving](10-kubernetes/)

Learn to serve ML models at scale using Kubernetes and TensorFlow Serving.

**Topics:**
- Kubernetes basics
- TensorFlow Serving
- Model deployment and scaling
- Load balancing



### [Capstone Project](projects/)

Choose a problem that interests you, find a suitable dataset, and develop your model. Deploy your model into a web service (local deployment or cloud deployment for bonus points).

## Certificates

To receive a certificate, you'll need to:

1. **Join a live cohort** (self-paced learners cannot earn certificates)
2. **Complete 2 out of 3 projects**:
   - **Midterm Project**: Choose a problem that interests you, find a suitable dataset, and develop your model
