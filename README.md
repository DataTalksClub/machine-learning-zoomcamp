**Note**: Self-paced learning gives you access to all course materials and recordings, but you need to join a live cohort to earn a certificate.

## What This Course Is About

This is a practical course where you'll learn to build and deploy machine learning systems. We focus on the engineering side from training models to getting them to work in production.

**You'll learn:**
- Core ML algorithms and when to use them
- How to prepare data and engineer features
- Model evaluation and selection
- Deploying models with Flask, Docker, and cloud platforms
- Using Kubernetes for ML model serving
- MLOps practices

**What makes this course different:**
- **Hands-on approach**: Build real projects, not just follow tutorials
- **Practical focus**: Heavily focused on implementation over mathematical theory
- **End-to-end focus**: From data to deployment
- **Community-driven**: Learn alongside others, get help when stuck
- **Open source**: All materials on GitHub, contribute improvements
- **Free**: No paywalls, no premium tiers

**Technical setup**: For machine learning modules, you only need a laptop with internet connection. For deep learning sections, we'll use cloud resources (like Saturn Cloud) for more intensive computations.

## Prerequisites

**You'll need:**
- Some programming experience (1+ years, preferably Python)
- Basic Python knowledge: variables, libraries, and Jupyter notebooks
- Basic command line comfort
- High school math

**Helpful but not required:**
- Statistics background
- Git/GitHub familiarity

No machine learning experience needed, we'll start from the basics.

## Syllabus

### [Module 1: Introduction to Machine Learning](01-intro/)
