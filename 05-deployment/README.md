## 5. Deploying Machine Learning Models

Note: these materials are partly outdated, which
is why we recorded a workshop that updates this module.
You will find the materials in the [workshop/](workshop/) folder

The theory in the module is still relevant, which is why we suggest you
to watch both the workshop and the module content. While watching 
the module content, focus on the theory part. The practical 
part is all covered in the workshop. 


- 5.1 [Intro / Session overview](01-intro.md)
- 5.2 [Saving and loading the model](02-pickle.md)
- 5.3 [Web services: introduction to Flask](03-flask-intro.md)
- 5.4 [Serving the churn model with Flask](04-flask-deployment.md)
- 5.5 [Python virtual environment: Pipenv](05-pipenv.md)
- 5.6 [Environment management: Docker](06-docker.md)
- 5.7 [Deployment to the cloud: AWS Elastic Beanstalk (optional)](07-aws-eb.md)
- 5.8 [Summary](08-summary.md)
- 5.9 [Explore more](09-explore-more.md)
- 5.10 [Homework](homework.md)


How to watch it:

- First, watch the units 5.1-5.6 
- Then watch the workshop and do the practice 
- Finally, do the homework
