Select the option that's closest to your solution.
If it's exactly in between two options, select the higher value.

### Dataset

In this homework, we will use the California Housing Prices from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/camnugent/california-housing-prices).

Here's a wget-able [link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alexeygrigorev/datasets/master/housing.csv):

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alexeygrigorev/datasets/master/housing.csv
```

The goal of this homework is to create a regression model for predicting housing prices (column `'median_house_value'`).

### EDA

* Load the data.
* Look at the `median_house_value` variable. Does it have a long tail? 

### Features

For the rest of the homework, you'll need to use only these columns:

* `'latitude'`,
* `'longitude'`,
* `'housing_median_age'`,
* `'total_rooms'`,
* `'total_bedrooms'`,
* `'population'`,
* `'households'`,
* `'median_income'`,
* `'median_house_value'`

Select only them.

### Question 1

Find a feature with missing values. How many missing values does it have?
- 207
- 307
- 408
- 508

### Question 2

What's the median (50% percentile) for variable 'population'?
- 1133
- 1122
- 1166
- 1188

### Split the data

* Shuffle the initial dataset, use seed `42`.
* Split your data in train/val/test sets, with 60%/20%/20% distribution.
* Make sure that the target value ('median_house_value') is not in your dataframe.
* Apply the log transformation to the median_house_value variable using the `np.log1p()` function.

### Question 3

* We need to deal with missing values for the column from Q1.
* We have two options: fill it with 0 or with the mean of this variable.
* Try both options. For each, train a linear regression model without regularization using the code from the lessons.
* For computing the mean, use the training only!
* Use the validation dataset to evaluate the models and compare the RMSE of each option.
* Round the RMSE scores to 2 decimal digits using `round(score, 2)`
* Which option gives better RMSE?

Options:
- With 0
- With mean
- Both are equally good

### Question 4

* Now let's train a regularized linear regression.
* For this question, fill the NAs with 0. 
* Try different values of `r` from this list: `[0, 0.000001, 0.0001, 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1, 5, 10]`.
* Use RMSE to evaluate the model on the validation dataset.
* Round the RMSE scores to 2 decimal digits.
* Which `r` gives the best RMSE?

If there are multiple options, select the smallest `r`.

Options:
- 0
- 0.000001
- 0.001
- 0.0001

### Question 5 

* We used seed 42 for splitting the data. Let's find out how selecting the seed influences our score.
* Try different seed values: `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`.
* For each seed, do the train/validation/test split with 60%/20%/20% distribution.
* Fill the missing values with 0 and train a model without regularization.
* For each seed, evaluate the model on the validation dataset and collect the RMSE scores. 
* What's the standard deviation of all the scores? To compute the standard deviation, use `np.std`.
* Round the result to 3 decimal digits (`round(std, 3)`)

> Note: Standard deviation shows how different the values are.
> If it's low, then all values are approximately the same.
> If it's high, the values are different. 
> If standard deviation of scores is low, then our model is *stable*.

Options:
- 0.16
- 0.00005
- 0.005
- 0.15555

### Question 6

* Split the dataset like previously, use seed 9.
* Combine train and validation datasets.
* Fill the missing values with 0 and train a model with `r=0.001`. 
* What's the RMSE on the test dataset?

Options:
- 0.35
- 0.135
- 0.450
- 0.245
