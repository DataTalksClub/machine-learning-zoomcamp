## 3.15 Homework

### Dataset

In this homework, we will continue the New York City Airbnb Open Data. You can take it from
[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/dgomonov/new-york-city-airbnb-open-data?select=AB_NYC_2019.csv)
or download from [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alexeygrigorev/datasets/master/AB_NYC_2019.csv)
if you don't want to sign up to Kaggle.

We'll keep working with the `'price'` variable, and we'll transform it to a classification task.


### Features

For the rest of the homework, you'll need to use the features from the previous homework with additional two `'neighbourhood_group'` and `'room_type'`. So the whole feature set will be set as follows:

* `'neighbourhood_group'`,
* `'room_type'`,
* `'latitude'`,
* `'longitude'`,
* `'price'`,
* `'minimum_nights'`,
* `'number_of_reviews'`,
* `'reviews_per_month'`,
* `'calculated_host_listings_count'`,
* `'availability_365'`

Select only them and fill in the missing values with 0.


### Question 1

What is the most frequent observation (mode) for the column `'neighbourhood_group'`?


### Split the data

* Split your data in train/val/test sets, with 60%/20%/20% distribution.
* Use Scikit-Learn for that (the `train_test_split` function) and set the seed to 42.
* Make sure that the target value ('price') is not in your dataframe.


### Question 2

* Create the [correlation matrix](https://www.google.com/search?q=correlation+matrix) for the numerical features of your train dataset.
   * In a correlation matrix, you compute the correlation coefficient between every pair of features in the dataset.
* What are the two features that have the biggest correlation in this dataset?


### Make price binary

* We need to turn the price variable from numeric into binary.
* Let's create a variable `above_average` which is `1` if the price is above (or equal to) `152`.


### Question 3

 * Calculate the mutual information score between `above_average` and the two other categorical variables in our dataset. Use the training set only.
* Round the scores to 2 decimals using `round(score, 2)`
* Which of these two variables has a bigger mutual information score?



### Question 4

* Now let's train a logistic regression
* Remember that we have two categorical variables in the data. Include them using one-hot encoding.
* Fit the model on the training dataset.
   * To make sure the results are reproducible across different versions of Scikit-Learn, fit the model with these parameters:
   * `model = LogisticRegression(solver='lbfgs', C=1.0, random_state=42)`
* Calculate the accuracy on the validation dataset and round it to 2 decimal digits.


### Question 5

* We have 9 features: 7 numerical features and 2 categorical.
* Let's find the least useful one using the *feature elimination* technique.
* Train a model with all these features (using the same parameters as in Q4).
* Now exclude each feature from this set and train a model without it. Record the accuracy for each model.
* For each feature, calculate the difference between the original accuracy and the accuracy without the feature. 
* Which of following feature has the smallest difference? 
   * `neighbourhood_group`
   * `room_type` 
   * `number_of_reviews`
   * `reviews_per_month`

> **note**: the difference doesn't have to be positive


### Question 6

* For this question, we'll see how to use a linear regression model from Scikit-Learn
* We'll need to use the original column `'price'`. Apply the logarithmic transformation to this column.
* Fit the Ridge regression model on the training data.
* This model has a parameter `alpha`. Let's try the following values: `[0, 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10]`
* Which of these alphas leads to the best RMSE on the validation set? Round your RMSE scores to 3 decimal digits.

If there are multiple options, select the smallest `alpha`.


## Submit the results

Submit your results here: https://forms.gle/xGpZhoq9Efm9E4RA9

It's possible that your answers won't match exactly. If it's the case, select the closest one. If it's exactly in between two options, select the higher value.


## Deadline

The deadline for submitting is 27 September 2021, 17:00 CET. After that, the form will be closed.
