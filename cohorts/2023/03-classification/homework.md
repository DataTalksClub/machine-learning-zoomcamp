## Homework

> Note: sometimes your answer doesn't match one of the options exactly. That's fine. 
Select the option that's closest to your solution.
If it's exactly in between two options, select the higher value.

### Dataset

In this homework, we will use the Car price dataset. Download it from [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alexeygrigorev/mlbookcamp-code/master/chapter-02-car-price/data.csv).

Or you can do it with `wget`:

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alexeygrigorev/mlbookcamp-code/master/chapter-02-car-price/data.csv
```

We'll keep working with the `MSRP` variable, and we'll transform it to a classification task. 

### Features

For the rest of the homework, you'll need to use only these columns:

* `Make`,
* `Model`,
* `Year`,
* `Engine HP`,
* `Engine Cylinders`,
* `Transmission Type`,
* `Vehicle Style`,
* `highway MPG`,
* `city mpg`,
* `MSRP`

### Data preparation

* Select only the features from above and transform their names using the next line:
  ```
  data.columns = data.columns.str.replace(' ', '_').str.lower()
  ```
* Fill in the missing values of the selected features with 0.
* Rename `MSRP` variable to `price`.

### Question 1

What is the most frequent observation (mode) for the column `transmission_type`?

- `AUTOMATIC`
- `MANUAL`
- `AUTOMATED_MANUAL`
- `DIRECT_DRIVE`


### Question 2

Create the [correlation matrix](https://www.google.com/search?q=correlation+matrix) for the numerical features of your dataset. 
In a correlation matrix, you compute the correlation coefficient between every pair of features in the dataset.

What are the two features that have the biggest correlation in this dataset?

- `engine_hp` and `year`
- `engine_hp` and `engine_cylinders`
- `highway_mpg` and `engine_cylinders`
- `highway_mpg` and `city_mpg`


### Make `price` binary

* Now we need to turn the `price` variable from numeric into a binary format.
* Let's create a variable `above_average` which is `1` if the `price` is above its mean value and `0` otherwise.

### Split the data

* Split your data in train/val/test sets with 60%/20%/20% distribution.
* Use Scikit-Learn for that (the `train_test_split` function) and set the seed to `42`.
* Make sure that the target value (`above_average`) is not in your dataframe.

### Question 3

* Calculate the mutual information score between `above_average` and other categorical variables in our dataset. 
  Use the training set only.
* Round the scores to 2 decimals using `round(score, 2)`.

Which of these variables has the lowest mutual information score?
  
- `make`
- `model`
- `transmission_type`
- `vehicle_style`


### Question 4

* Now let's train a logistic regression.
* Remember that we have several categorical variables in the dataset. Include them using one-hot encoding.
* Fit the model on the training dataset.
    - To make sure the results are reproducible across different versions of Scikit-Learn, fit the model with these parameters:
    - `model = LogisticRegression(solver='liblinear', C=10, max_iter=1000, random_state=42)`
* Calculate the accuracy on the validation dataset and round it to 2 decimal digits.

What accuracy did you get?

- 0.60
- 0.72
- 0.84
- 0.95


### Question 5 

* Let's find the least useful feature using the *feature elimination* technique.
* Train a model with all these features (using the same parameters as in Q4).
* Now exclude each feature from this set and train a model without it. Record the accuracy for each model.
* For each feature, calculate the difference between the original accuracy and the accuracy without the feature. 

Which of following feature has the smallest difference?

- `year`
- `engine_hp`
- `transmission_type`
- `city_mpg`

> **Note**: the difference doesn't have to be positive


### Question 6

* For this question, we'll see how to use a linear regression model from Scikit-Learn.
* We'll need to use the original column `price`. Apply the logarithmic transformation to this column.
* Fit the Ridge regression model on the training data with a solver `'sag'`. Set the seed to `42`.
* This model also has a parameter `alpha`. Let's try the following values: `[0, 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10]`.
* Round your RMSE scores to 3 decimal digits.

Which of these alphas leads to the best RMSE on the validation set?

- 0
- 0.01
- 0.1
- 1
- 10

> **Note**: If there are multiple options, select the smallest `alpha`.
