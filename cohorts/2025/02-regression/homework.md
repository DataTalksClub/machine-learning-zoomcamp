### Dataset

For this homework, we'll use the Car Fuel Efficiency dataset. Download it from <a href='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alexeygrigorev/datasets/master/car_fuel_efficiency.csv'>here</a>.

You can do it with wget:
```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alexeygrigorev/datasets/master/car_fuel_efficiency.csv
```

The goal of this homework is to create a regression model for predicting the car fuel efficiency (column `'fuel_efficiency_mpg'`).

### Preparing the dataset 

Use only the following columns:

* `'engine_displacement'`,
* `'horsepower'`,
* `'vehicle_weight'`,
* `'model_year'`,
* `'fuel_efficiency_mpg'`

### EDA

* Look at the `fuel_efficiency_mpg` variable. Does it have a long tail? 

### Question 1

There's one column with missing values. What is it?

* `'engine_displacement'`
* `'horsepower'`
* `'vehicle_weight'`
* `'model_year'`


### Question 2

What's the median (50% percentile) for variable `'horsepower'`?

- 49
- 99
- 149
- 199

### Prepare and split the dataset

* Shuffle the dataset (the filtered one you created above), use seed `42`.
* Split your data in train/val/test sets, with 60%/20%/20% distribution.

Use the same code as in the lectures


### Question 3

* We need to deal with missing values for the column from Q1.
* We have two options: fill it with 0 or with the mean of this variable.
* Try both options. For each, train a linear regression model without regularization using the code from the lessons.
* For computing the mean, use the training only!
* Use the validation dataset to evaluate the models and compare the RMSE of each option.
* Round the RMSE scores to 2 decimal digits using `round(score, 2)`
* Which option gives better RMSE?

Options:

- With 0
- With mean
- Both are equally good


### Question 4

* Now let's train a regularized linear regression.
* For this question, fill the NAs with 0. 
* Try different values of `r` from this list: `[0, 0.01, 0.1, 1, 5, 10, 100]`.
* Use RMSE to evaluate the model on the validation dataset.
* Round the RMSE scores to 2 decimal digits.
* Which `r` gives the best RMSE?

If multiple options give the same best RMSE, select the smallest `r`.

Options:

- 0
- 0.01
- 1
- 10
- 100


### Question 5 

* We used seed 42 for splitting the data. Let's find out how selecting the seed influences our score.
* Try different seed values: `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`.
* For each seed, do the train/validation/test split with 60%/20%/20% distribution.
* Fill the missing values with 0 and train a model without regularization.
* For each seed, evaluate the model on the validation dataset and collect the RMSE scores. 
* What's the standard deviation of all the scores? To compute the standard deviation, use `np.std`.
* Round the result to 3 decimal digits (`round(std, 3)`)

What's the value of std?

- 0.001
- 0.006
- 0.060
- 0.600

> Note: Standard deviation shows how different the values are.
> If it's low, then all values are approximately the same.
> If it's high, the values are different. 
> If standard deviation of scores is low, then our model is *stable*.


### Question 6

* Split the dataset like previously, use seed 9.
* Combine train and validation datasets.
* Fill the missing values with 0 and train a model with `r=0.001`. 
* What's the RMSE on the test dataset?

Options:

- 0.15
- 0.515
- 5.15
- 51.5
