In this homework, we will use the lead scoring dataset Bank Marketing dataset. Download it from [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alexeygrigorev/datasets/master/course_lead_scoring.csv).


In this dataset our desired target for classification task will be `converted` variable - has the client signed up to the platform or not. 

### Data preparation

* Check if the missing values are presented in the features.
* If there are missing values:
    * For caterogiral features, replace them with 'NA'
    * For numerical features, replace with with 0.0 


Split the data into 3 parts: train/validation/test with 60%/20%/20% distribution. Use `train_test_split` function for that with `random_state=1`


### Question 1: ROC AUC feature importance

ROC AUC could also be used to evaluate feature importance of numerical variables. 

Let's do that

* For each numerical variable, use it as score (aka prediction) and compute the AUC with the `y` variable as ground truth.
* Use the training dataset for that


If your AUC is < 0.5, invert this variable by putting "-" in front

(e.g. `-df_train['balance']`)

AUC can go below 0.5 if the variable is negatively correlated with the target variable. You can change the direction of the correlation by negating this variable - then negative correlation becomes positive.

Which numerical variable (among the following 4) has the highest AUC?

- `lead_score`
- `number_of_courses_viewed`
- `interaction_count`
- `annual_income`

### Question 2: Training the model

Apply one-hot-encoding using `DictVectorizer` and train the logistic regression with these parameters:

```python
LogisticRegression(solver='liblinear', C=1.0, max_iter=1000)
```

What's the AUC of this model on the validation dataset? (round to 3 digits)

- 0.32
- 0.52
- 0.72
- 0.92


### Question 3: Precision and Recall

Now let's compute precision and recall for our model.

* Evaluate the model on all thresholds from 0.0 to 1.0 with step 0.01
* For each threshold, compute precision and recall
* Plot them

At which threshold precision and recall curves intersect?

* 0.145
* 0.345
* 0.545
* 0.745


### Question 4: F1 score

Precision and recall are conflicting - when one grows, the other goes down. That's why they are often combined into the F1 score - a metrics that takes into account both

This is the formula for computing F1:

$$F_1 = 2 \cdot \cfrac{P \cdot R}{P + R}$$

Where $P$ is precision and $R$ is recall.

Let's compute F1 for all thresholds from 0.0 to 1.0 with increment 0.01

At which threshold F1 is maximal?

- 0.14
- 0.34
- 0.54
- 0.74


### Question 5: 5-Fold CV


Use the `KFold` class from Scikit-Learn to evaluate our model on 5 different folds:

```
KFold(n_splits=5, shuffle=True, random_state=1)
```

* Iterate over different folds of `df_full_train`
* Split the data into train and validation
* Train the model on train with these parameters: `LogisticRegression(solver='liblinear', C=1.0, max_iter=1000)`
* Use AUC to evaluate the model on validation

How large is standard deviation of the scores across different folds?

- 0.0001
- 0.006
- 0.06
- 0.36


### Question 6: Hyperparameter Tuning

Now let's use 5-Fold cross-validation to find the best parameter `C`

* Iterate over the following `C` values: `[0.000001, 0.001, 1]`
* Initialize `KFold` with the same parameters as previously
* Use these parameters for the model: `LogisticRegression(solver='liblinear', C=C, max_iter=1000)`
* Compute the mean score as well as the std (round the mean and std to 3 decimal digits)

Which `C` leads to the best mean score?

- 0.000001
- 0.001
- 1

If you have ties, select the score with the lowest std. If you still have ties, select the smallest `C`.
